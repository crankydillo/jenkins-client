Hudson CLI Tool

Introduction
------------

This tool presents a few useful mechanisms for grabbing information and builds
from Hudson.  For example, to get the lastStableBuild, all that needs to be
executed is: > retrieve


info.bat
--------

Provides meta-data information about a Hudson module.  The module is defined
within the info.bat file (MODPATH variable).

Executing:

> info

will print out some statistics like last completed build, last stable build,
etc. as well as a list of the build numbers.

Executing:

> info ${build_num}

will print out more detailed information about a particular build.


retrieve.bat
------------

Retrieves an artifact from Hudson, explodes it, and deletes the downloaded file.
The assumption is that artifact is a ZIP file.  The JVM-based application -e
${base_dir} and -d control the explosion and deletion.  If you just want the
downloaded file, remove these arguments from the Java command in the bat file.

The MODPATH and RELPATH variables along with the build number control what
artifact is retrieved.

Executing:

> retrieve ${build_num}

will download the artifact that corresponds to that build number (plus MODPATH
and RELPATH) into the file name ${build_num}.zip.  If ${build_num}.zip exists,
it is overwritten.  The application attempts to explode the archive in
${BASEDIR}/${build_num} ONLY IF THAT DIRECTORY DOES NOT EXIST.  If it cannot do
this, it will leave the downloaded file for you to handle manually.

> retrieve

will download the last stable build.  The desired target directory is
${BASEDIR}/${calculated_build_num}-lastStable.  All existing directories in
${BASEDIR} that end with -lastStable are renamed.

TODO: Elaborate on the renaming algorithm.
